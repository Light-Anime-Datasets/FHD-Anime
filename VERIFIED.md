## Verified, needs collecting

A list of verified FHD anime
that have yet to be collected.

| TABOO TATTOO   |
| Kuutei Dragons |

## Excluded anime

A list of anime that were checked
and _may_ be FHD,
but we're too uncertain about
to include in the dataset in good conscious.

This list also contains FHD native anime
that were excluded for different reasons,
primarily authoring or mastering related.

| Anime                           | FHD?    | Notes                                                                                                                       |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Date a Live III                 | Unknown | JP BDMV is lowpassed. Have to check other BDMVs.                                                                            |
| Hataage! Kemono Michi           | Unknown | Some 945p spikes. Lots of compression ringing and slight blurring, making it difficult to ascertain whether it's truly FHD. |
| Majimoji Rurumo                 | Unknown | JP BDMV is lowpassed. Waiting for other BDMV sources to show up.                                                            |
| The Quintessential Quintuplets~ | Unknown | JP BDMV is lowpassed. Waiting for other BDMV sources to show up.                                                            |

Anime on this list that _are_ FHD
(or unknown)
may be revisited
in the event a better source has been found
or released.

## Verified non-FHD Anime

A list of anime that were checked,
but are not native FHD.
Please check this list before creating an issue!

| Anime            | Note                                                                                            |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| BOCCHI THE ROCK! | Post-sharpened, ~873p                                                                           |
| Flying Witch     | Very soft, faint (horizontal) ringing. Likely a high 900s production, but not certain it's FHD. |
