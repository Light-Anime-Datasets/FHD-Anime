# Excluded anime

A list of anime that were checked
and _may_ be FHD,
but we're too uncertain about
to include in the dataset in good conscious.

This list also contains FHD native anime
that were excluded for different reasons,
primarily authoring or mastering related.

| Anime                           | FHD?    | Notes                                                                              |
| ------------------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Flying Witch                    | No?     | Very soft, faint (horizontal) ringing. Likely a high 900s production, but not FHD. |
| The Quintessential Quintuplets~ | Unknown | JP BDMV is lowpassed. Waiting for other BDMV sources to show up.                   |

Anime on this list that _are_ FHD
(or unknown)
may be revisited
in the event a better source has been found
or released.
